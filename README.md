An example of using Django Channels to implement chat room

See https://blog.heroku.com/in_deep_with_django_channels_the_future_of_real_time_apps_in_django

The implementation is not completely same as its origin from Jacob Kaplan-Moss.

## Differences
- Traditional dir organization from Django is used.
- Local cached Google Raleway font is used due to Internet access limitations in China.
